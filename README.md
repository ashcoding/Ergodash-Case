# Ergodash-Case


As of 25-March-2019, this design has not been tested. If you build one, let me know and I'll remove this warning.

This is a tenting case for the Ergodash. This case is designed for 3/32 silicon feet on the underside of the PCB. 

Uses standard 3mm hardware. You'll need four (4) bolts (I recommend thumbscrews) 16mm long, four (4) nuts, and 14 #0 x 5/16" Flat Head Sheet Metal Screws (90065A022 on McMaster).

There is no restriction on pro micro mounting height with this design. I recommend peel-a-way sockets, available at keeb.io. Be sure to trim switch legs under the micro and use a piece of tape for electrical insulation.

The hat will need to be glued in place. The switchplate has provisions to add some adhesive to the locating pins on the hat from the underside. Attach the hat to the switchplate before you solder any switches onto your pcb.

To improve traction, wrap a #30 rubber band around each leg lengthwise. Compatible with Ergodox EZ legs as well.

These models were created in standard units (inches).
